Description: A function to convert GDP time series from one unit to another.
    All common GDP units are included, i.e. current and constant local currency
    units, US$ via market exchange rates and international dollars via
    purchasing power parities. Conversion factors can easily be customized. 
    Conversion at a regional/aggregated level is also possible.
